# 7 GUIs in React with TypeScript

7GUIs is a set of small GUI programming tasks intended to test the capabilities of a GUI framework, see https://eugenkiss.github.io/6guis/tasks. This webpage is my attempt to do these seven tasks using React.

## Running

This project uses Vite and is based on one of the React templates that Vite provides, so it's not complicated to set up.

To test it out, run the following commands in the root directory of the project:

1.  `npm install`
2.  `npm run dev`

Then, open the localhost link output to the terminal in a web browser.
